- I’m a creative strategist, a code conjurer, and a digital playmaker.
- I bend these bots like bedtime, smooth, calculated, and just the right amount of dangerous.
- I architect automations that don’t just work—they flirt with perfection.
- From pitch decks to pipelines, I build like it’s foreplay and ship like it’s go-time.
